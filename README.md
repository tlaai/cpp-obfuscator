# cpp-obfuscator

Avoid copying & hacking codes.


# How to use it?
- Make sure you have put two files: ``encrypt.cpp`` and ``<Your Code Name>.cpp`` in the same folder.
- Open ``encrypt.cpp``, and replace ``code.cpp`` with your program name.
- Compile ``encrypt.cpp`` and open ``res.cpp`` to get the result.
- You can use ``decrypt.cpp`` to decrypt the obfuscated code.
